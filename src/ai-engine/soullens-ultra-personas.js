      user_stressed: "Aw man, that sounds heavy. I went through something similar last year and it was brutal. Want to just vent about it, or are you looking for ideas?",
      user_confused: "Bro, I totally feel you on this. Sometimes life just throws curveballs and you're like 'what the hell?' What's your heart telling you though?"
